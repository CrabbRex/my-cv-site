# Rex Crabb CV Website
Welcome to my personal CV and Portfolio website!
This site showcases my skills, projects and growing experience as a developer. It is built with **Next.js** and deployed using **Vercel** with **continous deployment**.
This website is still being improved upon as I continue to learn and implement new features.

## Features:
- Responsive, mobile-friendly design
- Clean, minimal UI
- Individual pages for Landing page, Projects, CV and About Me
- Animated navigation bar using React state and Framer Motion
- Easy content updates via GitHub + Vercel CD

## Stack:
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Vercel
- GitHub

## Security:
- HTTPS provided through Vercel deployment
- Domain Security via registrar protection
- Basic security hygiene

## Continous Deployment:
Every push to the main branch triggers an automatic build and deployment via Vercel.
Feature branches can be utilised to develop new features or fixes; once ready can be merged into main to deploy new features.

## To-Do / Future Improvements:
- Overhaul projects page.
    - Add Motion animations 
    - Implement project sliders/carousel, cycling through projects.
- Enhance mobile navigation and layout.
- Add CI Pipeline with linting and unit testing.
- Explore API usage for minimal improvements.


## What I Have Leant:
This project has taught me a lot. It was done solo with no prior experience with Next.js, however some experience with React. The learning curve felt steep at the start but helped me grow in these areas:
- Website development with **Next.js**
- Styling and layout with **Tailwind CSS**
- Implementing animations with **Framer Motion**
- Undersatnding **Client/Server Model**, including when to abstract interactive UI into client components.
- Creating clean UI/UX through interative development
